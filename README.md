## OVERVIEW



## IMPLEMENTATION
The getMatchValue method retrieves the match value and checks it against the t value in a single lookup, improving performance.
Benefits of This Approach
Single Pass Parsing: By parsing the input string once and storing the values in a map, we avoid multiple iterations, leading to a more efficient lookup.
Constant Time Lookups: Retrieving values from a HashMap is on average O(1), making it faster than repeatedly searching through an array or a list.
Readability: The code is clear and maintains a separation of concerns, making it easier to understand and maintain.
This optimized approach effectively increases performance while retaining clarity and functionality
